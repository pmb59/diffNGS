# diffNGS
<h4> R scripts to identify differential regions in normalized bigwig datasets of replicated ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq, MeRIP-seq, etc. </h4>

Peak calling at each condition and generation of normalized bigwig tracks of the samples should be done before using diffNGS. It requires BEDtools and a GTF file with annotated gene features.

The code is still under active development, and I welcome biology and computational scientists for all kinds of collaborations and communications. Please feel free to contact Dr. Pedro Madrigal at pmb59(AT)cam.ac.uk if you have any question.
